React Native components will be mapped to native widgets.
React Native components are platform independent.
Metro Bundler is responsible for compiling all JavaScript files into a single file.
React Native can perform fast refreshing. It allows us to see changes as soon as they are saved. We don't have to wait for the native build to finish.

DEBUGGING:
Shake device -> Debug Remote JS -> DevTools -> Sources -> Pause on exceptions in top right -> Pause on caught exceptions -> Reload JS from device

COMPONENTS:
FlatList:
	- Turns an array into a list of elements
	- Must pass in a prop of data - the array of data that we are going to create a bunch of elements out of
	- Also required to pass in a 'renderItem' prop - function that will turn each individual item into an element
	- If you are coming from React on the web, you might be used to 'mapping' an array of data to build a list - FlatList is better with RN
	- If you do not provide a key to the renderItem root DOM node and you try to delete one of the list items, the whole list will be deleted and reconstructed
